# Derivative Calculator

This is a derivative calculator web application that allows users to calculate derivatives of mathematical expressions. It provides options for simplification and differentiation. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to enter mathematical expressions
- Options to simplify or differentiate the expressions
- Adjustable order for higher-order derivatives
- Interactive graph visualization of the function and its derivative
- Error handling for invalid input or calculations

## Tools and Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) - Library for rendering mathematical expressions
- [Math.js](https://mathjs.org/) - Library for mathematical calculations
- [JSXGraph](https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/) - Library for interactive graphs

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a mathematical expression in the input field.
3. Choose whether to simplify or differentiate the expression.
4. Optionally, adjust the order of the derivative and the variable to differentiate with respect to.
5. Click the "Calculate" button to perform the calculation.
6. The result will be displayed along with the input expression and any additional results.
